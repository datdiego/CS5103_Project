## Word Statistics

#### Version 0.1

### Requirements:
1. In this project you are writing a program to perform various word
statistics of a given document (as a string). The initial requirement is to count the
frequency of each unique word. The code should support combinations of space, tab, and
newline characters as separators. 

2. The second requirement change is to allow replacement of all
occurrences of a given word to a given replacement word. Note that the replacement
happens only when the given pattern word matches with a whole word. For example, for
text “ab cd ef”, replace “a” with

## How to run program
### On Shell
1. Change directory to where 'main.py' is located. (Make sure Python3 is installed)
2. Enter 'python3 main.py' on shell to run python file.
3. The program will initialize and there are two options:
   - Option (1) Select file to read from directory, one file already provided to test requirement 'data.txt'/
   - Can only read '.txt' files.
   - Option (2) Enter String to be analyzed by program.
4. The TEXT from past selection will print.
5. The program will give two options to start either requirements:
   - Option (1) will provide unique word statistics from the TEXT.
   - Option (2) will replace an old word from the text to a new word from user input.
6. Program will ask if user wants to restart program.
